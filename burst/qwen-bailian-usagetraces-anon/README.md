# Qwen-Bailian Anonymous Dataset

## Overview

This dataset contains a two-hour anonymized KVCache trace of requests sent to a single
Qwen model serving instance on **Aliyun Bailian**.
It is used for validating design techniques for LLM serving systems
as well as inspiring future usage with the following
key workload characteristics collected:

- Temporal distribution of requests;
- Input/output token length;
- Session structure and chat turn patterns;
- Request type composition (text, search, image, file)

## Key Features

- **Production-Representative**: Subset retains real-world traffic patterns
- **Privacy-Compliant**: Salted hashing + domain remapping anonymization
- **Structured Format**: JSON Lines with schema documentation
- **Apache 2.0 Licensed**: Permissive open-source license for commercial use

For insights that can be drawn from the dataset,
please refer to our works:

## Scenarios behind the traces

- To-C trace, e.g., ChatGPT-like service ([./qwen_traceA_blksz_16.jsonl](./qwen_traceA_blksz_16.jsonl)).
- To-B trace, e.g., task automation with API calling ([./qwen_traceB_blksz_16.jsonl](./qwen_traceB_blksz_16.jsonl)).


## Data Specification of the Traces 

Each file contains a representative workload, 
e.g., `qwen_traceB_blksz_16.jsonl` refer to a to-B trace collected at 2024.12.
Each record contains the following information: 

``` jsonc
{
  "chat_id": 159,                                   // Randomized chat identifier
  "parent_chat_id": 55,                             // -1 for root requests
  "timestamp": 61.114,                              // Seconds since request arrive
  "input_length": 521,                              // Input token count
  "output_length": 132,                             // Output token count
  "type": "text",                                   // Request type: text/search/image/file
  "turn": 2,                                        // Conversation turn number
  "hash_ids": [1089, 1090, 1091, 6326, ..., 13148]  // Salted SipHash blocks (16 tokens per block)
}
```

## Anonymization Process

1. **Token Block Hashing**:
    - Group tokens into 16-token blocks
    - Apply salted SipHash-2-4 to each block

2. **Domain Remapping**:
    - Map hash values to sequential integers
    - Breaks correlation between hash IDs and original content

3. **ID Randomization**:
    - Replace chat IDs with sequential integers
    - No linkage to user accounts or device identifiers

4. **Time-based Anonymization**:
    - All timestamps are normalized to trace-relative values, starting from 0 at the beginning of each trace file. Original absolute timestamps (e.g., Unix time) are removed to prevent temporal correlation with external events or user behavior patterns.

## Privacy & Compliance

- **No PII**: All content hashed with irreversible cryptographic functions
- **Unlinkable**: No cross-session or user-device associations preserved
- **GDPR/CCPA Compliant**: Meets anonymous data standards under major regulations
